# Directed study: identifying opportunities for scraping

It should be possible to scrape any public information which has some sort of structure or pattern. Look around your chosen field and try to identify online sources of information which might be suitable for scraping. Examples might include:

* Pages of results from searching a database (e.g. a jobs website)
* A series of documents linked from a single page, or series of pages
* A series of webpages with URLs that follow a particular pattern
* A series of webpages which all have a similar structure, or pattern of text

Try to scrape it. Come next week ready to troubleshoot your efforts.
