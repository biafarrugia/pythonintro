        "* **Menus**: the notebook has 7 menus, from *File* to *Help*. You can use these to export your notebook as pure Python script, bring up shortcuts and look at the code in different ways, among other things.\n",
        "* **+ CODE** and **+ TEXT** buttons: click on one of these to create a new section of code in your notebook, or a new section of text (at the moment the document has one empty code section)\n",

        "\n",
        "You can use Markdown in your text directly, too. Try typing the same special characters (e.g. asterisks immediately before and after words to make them bold and/or italic) to format text without having to use the buttons.\n",
