## Scraping and APIs

* Try [this guide to some lines of code you can use to interact with an API](/executepythononline.md)
* Next, read [this guide to using Morph.io](/scraping/morphio.md) and try the same code there (then adapt it to save the results)
* There's also a [guide to scraping a specific page (on auction listings)](/scraping/scrapingauctions.md)
* If you are a journalism student on the [MA in Data Journalism](https://www.bcu.ac.uk/media/courses/data-journalism-ma-2019-20) at Birmingham City University, you have access to a free copy of [Scraping for Journalists](https://leanpub.com/scrapingforjournalists).
