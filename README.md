* Second, move on to [this guide to some lines of code you can use to interact with an API](/executepythononline.md)

One good to way to use Python on your computer - while also building the habit of making notes for yourself and for your audiences - is a Jupyter notebook.

## Scraping and APIs

* Next, you can switch to Morph.io and [this guide to using it with an API](/scraping/morphio.md)
* There's also a [guide to scraping a specific page (on auction listings)](/scraping/scrapingauctions.md)
* If you are a journalism student on the [MA in Data Journalism](https://www.bcu.ac.uk/media/courses/data-journalism-ma-2019-20) at Birmingham City University, you have access to a free copy of [Scraping for Journalists](https://leanpub.com/scrapingforjournalists).
