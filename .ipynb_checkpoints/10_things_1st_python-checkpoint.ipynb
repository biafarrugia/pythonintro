    "# 10 things to do with Python first\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Install Python and Python notebooks\n",
    "\n",
    "The simplest way to get Python up and running on your computer is to [install Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/). This includes a number of tools such as Jupyter notebooks (for creating notebooks with working code - like this one) and Spyder, an environment for running code and seeing the variables you are working with (similar to RStudio, which is also included).\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Create a new notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you've installed Anaconda, open it. You should see a number of applications that you can launch (or install). On the Jupyter notebook box, click **Launch**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Depending on your computer, this will probably open a window and run some code in the background. Don't worry about this - just wait for it to finish and a new tab should open in your default browser at an address like `http://localhost:8888/tree/`.\n",
    "\n",
    "This isn't a web address, and it doesn't matter if you're connected to the internet - because this is an address on your own computer, which is now running a little server so you can run live Python code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hopefully you should recognise some of the folders listed there (like your main Documents folder, Downloads etc.). Navigate to a place where you want to keep your Python notebooks (click on folders to move into them) - and/or create a new folder especially for that.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you're in the folder you want to use, create a new notebook by clicking on **New** in the upper right corner, and select one of the options under *Notebooks* (if there's more than one it doesn't really matter for now which you choose).\n",
    "\n",
    "This will open a new tab for the new notebook. At this point there are 3 things to draw your attention to:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Its title - in the upper left corner - will be *Untitled*.\n",
    "2. Under that will be a number of menus and various buttons \n",
    "3. On the page itself will be a box that says `In [ ]:` with a flashing cursor after that. This is where you can type some working code and run it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's do the simple thing first: click on *Untitled* and change the name of the document to something meaningful like *python_notebook_test*.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now shift your attention to that flashing cursor.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `In [ ]:` means that this is a **code box**. If we want to write some code and run it, that's fine. Alternatively, however, we can write some narrative, or commentary, explaining the code. And that's what we want to do first.\n",
    "\n",
    "To change the code box to one that we can type normal text into, click on the dropdown menu above, that currently says *Code*. Change it to *Markdown*.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `In [ ]:` should now disappear. Now we can start writing an explanation before we create a code block.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Markdown** is a very simple language for writing and formatting text. You can just write text normally and it will be presented normally, but you can also use certain characters to format parts of text as headings, links, bullet or numbered lists, quotes and so on. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here are the main ones to knows:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Use hashes and a space (e.g. `# My test notebook` ) to create a **heading**. One hash creates a first level heading (the biggest and most important), two hashes creates a second level heading (not quite as important) and so on.\n",
    "* Put an asterisk immediately before and after a word or sentence (no space) to make it **italic**, like so: `I *really* want to learn Python`\n",
    "* Put two asterisks immediately before and after a word or sentence (no space) to make it **bold**, like so: `I really want to learn **Python**`\n",
    "* Put three asterisks immediately before and after a word or sentence (no space) to make it bold *and* italic, like so: `I ***really want to learn*** Python`\n",
    "* Use an asterisk and a space to create a **bullet point**, e.g. `* Task 1: write some code`\n",
    "* To create a **numbered list**, just use numbers instead of asterisks\n",
    "* To create a **link**, put square brackets around the text you want to link, then immediately after the closing square bracket (no space), put the URL of the link in normal parentheses, like so: `[the BBC homepage](http://bbc.co.uk)`\n",
    "* To create an **indented blockquote**, put a `>` character and a space, followed by the quote, like so: `> \"Python notebooks are an excellent way to share your code\"`\n",
    "\n",
    "You can [read more on Markdown in Python notebooks here](https://www.firstpythonnotebook.org/markdown/)\n",
    "\n",
    "Start your notebook by giving it a heading and an introduction, like so:\n",
    "\n",
    "```md\n",
    "# Test notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a test notebook. I'm going to try some code below.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you've typed some text, press the 'run cell' button that looks like a 'play' button (to the left of the 'stop' button), or select **Cell > Run Cells** from the menu.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Markdown cell should now 'run' and be converted, so the line with a hash now looks like a heading. \n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to edit this cell at any time, just double-click inside it, and then run the cell again when you've finished.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you ran the cell, it will also have created a new cell underneath. This will be a code cell again. Now you're ready to write some code. \n",
    "\n",
    "(*Note: if you ever need to create a new cell click on **Insert > Insert Cell Below** or **Insert Cell Above** to create a cell above or below the cell you are currently in.*)"
